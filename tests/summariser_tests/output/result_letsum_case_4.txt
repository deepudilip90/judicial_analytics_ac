", "Context": "", "Citation": "", "Analysis": "      It is averred that the Developer has miserably failed to comply with the contractual obligations of handing over possession of the subject Flat  and did not complete the construction work  which amounts to \u201cdeficiency of service\u201d on the part of the Developer and as the Complainant has suffered a lot of mental agony and financial strain at the hands of the Developer  he is entitled to be adequately compensated.\n    The contention of the learned Counsel for the Developer that the Complainant is not a \u2018Consumer\u2019 as he has purchased the said unit for commercial purpose is not substantiated by any documentary evidence and is completely unsustainable in the light of the judgement of this Commission in Kavita Ahuja vs. Shipra Estates I  2016  CPJ 31  NC   wherein this Commission has laid down the principle that the onus of establishing that the Complainant was dealing in real estate is on the Opposite Parties  which in the instant case they have failed to discharge or file any documentary evidence to establish that the Complainant is an \u2018Investor\u2019 and not a \u2018Consumer\u2019  therefore we are of the considered view that the Complainant is a \u2018Consumer\u2019 as defined under Section 2  1  d  of the Act.\n    Learned Counsel appearing for the Developer vehemently argued that Clause 3.3 specifies that the delivery of possession is subject to force majeure conditions and that there were several reasons and circumstances beyond the control of the Developer such as interim orders of the Hon\u2019ble Punjab and Haryana High Court  whereby ground water extraction was banned in Gurgaon and there was shortage of construction material and labour. All these aforenoted reasons do not fall within the ambit of reasons beyond their control and cannot be construed to be any substantial reason and definitely not a force majeure condition.  \n", "Conclusion": "Learned Counsel Developer time final Developer Occupation Certificate possession unit would handed short period time Occupation Even Written Version date handing possession subject Taking consideration fact time completion construction 2016 Developer admitted Written Version construction started October 2012 Developer give date time possession Occupation Certificate view Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court Pvt.
