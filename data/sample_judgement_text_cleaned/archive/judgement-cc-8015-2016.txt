 It has been alleged in the complaint that complainants booked residential unit in the project namely ‘Grand Arch’ at Golf Course Extension Road  Sector – 58  Gurgaon  of the opposite party paying booking amount of 9 29 400  . The offer of allotment for the residential apartment bearing Unit No. B 2401  Floor – 23  Tower D was received by the complainants on 10.12.2 
 Apartment Buyer agreement was executed on 11.01.2 The possession was to be given to the complainants within 36 months from the date of sanction of building plan. The complainants paid total amount of 1 06 07 085   from 18.09.2009 to 29.09.2 On 30.12.2015  the complainants received an e mail from the opposite party whereby it was informed that the apartment was ready for possession and the notice of possession dated 29 th December  2015 was enclosed and the opposite party further requested the complainants to complete the formalities so as to enable them to proceed with the handing over of the possession and conveyance of the apartment. It is important to note that the opposite party had also annexed a statement of account as on 29 th December  2015  wherein the compensation for delay in possession computed at 7.5 per sq.ft   per month  amounting to 5 68 591   was also shown. It is further alleged in the complaint that though the duration for which such compensation was computed had not been mentioned  however  the same appeared to have been computed from January  2013 until December  2 On 04.01.2016  the complainant sent an e mail to the opposite party that upon reviewing the statement of account attached to the letter of possession dated 29 th December  2015  it was noted that as part of the listing of amounts payable  the following two items for which the complainant had never applied or signed up and it was requested by the complainant that these items be immediately removed from the list of amounts payable  
Item f  Non refundable LEE club deposit 4 00 000   
Item g Club Membership Fee  Jan  2016 to June 2016 9 000   
 On the representation of the complainant  the opposite party agreed to waive off these charges. The complainant further objected to many of the demands of the opposite party  like  
I Infrastructure augmentation charges  IAC  
II Labour cost on project 
III Interest on delayed payment 
 Finally  the opposite party also agreed to waive off 59 305   and total 4 68 305   was deducted from the demand. The complainant asked further clarification from the opposite party about the delay penalty that was credited to the account of the complainant   7.5 sq.ft   per month amounting to 5 68 591  . The opposite party also clarified to the complainant that delay compensation has been calculated from 11.02.2013 to 29.12.2015 after taking into consideration the period of construction of 36 months alongwith six months grace period. The complainant replied to the aforesaid clarification of the opposite party that the net payable amount as per the reconciliation until that date should be 4 55 035    and not 9 31 467   as stated in the email of the opposite party . The complainant further mentioned that since the total amount of stamp duty   registration charges   admin charges adds to 6 16 500   and since the net payable amount was less  the said charges amounting to 1 16 465    which amount is deemed to be in reserve with the opposite party as amount overpaid excluding consideration for registration related charges  it stands clear that the entire balance of 4 55 035   would apply to registration etc  only if the complainant decides to take possession. On 17.02.2016  the complainant wrote to the opposite party that the compensation of 7.5 sq.ft   per month is very less and the opposite party should pay interest on the total deposited amount   18  per annum for the delay in handing over the possession. It has been alleged in the complaint that the opposite party has not explained the 
reasons for delay neither have they adjusted   paid the interest on the deposited capital for the delayed period   18  per annum. Aggrieved by these acts of the opposite party  the complainants have filed the present complaint. 
 The complaint has been resisted by the opposite party by filing the written statement. It has been stated by the opposite party that they offered the complete unit for possession  as accepted in the complaint  to the allottees vide letter dated 29.12.2 Complainants were offered possession after obtaining the occupation certificate dated 18.09.2014 for the towers A B C   H of the project issued by the DGTCP  Haryana. Opposite party further alleged that after adjustment of delay compensation which was calculated   7.5   per sq  ft per month i.e. Rs  5 68 591   payable as per terms of Buyer’s Agreement dated 11.01.2011  complainants were required to pay an amount of Rs  9 31 467   towards heads mentioned in the letter. Upon the request of the complainants  charges payable towards “Quick Real Estate Pvt. Ltd.” which was inclusive of club membership fee  annual club charges and service tax amounting to Rs  4 68 305   were waived off since the complainants opted out of the same. As per policy of the opposite party “Timely Payment Rebate Scheme” the complainants have been given a rebate of Rs  1 57 599   by the opposite party. Opposite party stated that despite the aforesaid relaxations and benefits given to the complainants  the complainants in utter disregard to the terms of the agreement  failed to remit the balance amount payable and filed the complaint to evade the liability of payment of due amount. It has been stated that in the instant case there was a delay of 1051 days in offering the possession and the complainants have been suitably compensated in terms of the agreement. It has been requested to dismiss the complaint. 
 Learned counsel for both the parties filed their evidence by way of affidavits which have been taken on record. 
 On the date of hearing  learned counsel for the opposite party withdrew his vakalatnama. Therefore  learned counsel for the complainants was heard. 
 The learned counsel for the complainants reiterated the facts as mentioned above and stated that there has been a huge delay in handing over the possession  hence  the complainants are entitled to get adequate compensation over and above the provision of penalty for delayed possession as mentioned in the Buyer’s Agreement. It was stated by learned counsel for the complainants that in catena of cases Hon’ble Supreme Court as well as this Commission have held that complainants would be entitled to compensation and interest commensurate with the loss of opportunity cost suffered by them on account of the delay on the part of opposite party in handing over the possession and also compensation for mental agony suffered by the complainants on account of delay in getting possession of flat. In support of his statement  the learned counsel for the complainant referred to the judgment of this Commission in the case of Parvinder Singh and Ors. Vs Unitech Limited and Ors  in Consumer Case No  449 of 2013  decided on 12.02.2016  wherein this commission held that there is no justification for restricting the compensation to Rs50   per sq  yard per month as laid down in the agreement for an indefinite period as this will tantamount to great injustice to the complainant. So  this Commission directed OP to pay compensation to complainants in the form of simple interest   12  p.a  from the date of agreement till the possession is delivered to the complainant. 
 I have perused the written statement filed by the opposite party and it has been submitted therein that the Apartment Buyers Agreement was entered into between the parties and as such the parties are bound by the terms and conditions mentioned in the said agreement as held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Bharti Knitting co  vs. DHL Worldwide Courier  1996  4 SCC 704 wherein  the Hon’ble Apex Court has observed that a person who signed  a document containing contract and terms is normally bound by them even though he has not read them  and even though he is ignorant of their precise legal effect. All the other objections taken by the opposite party in the written statement have also been duly considered. 
Observations
 I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the complainants as well as the objections and arguments raised in the written statement filed by the opposite party. The complainants have made following prayers in the complaint   
a  hold the opposite party guilty of deficiency in service and unfair trade practice against the complainant herein  
b  direct the opposite party to handover the physical possession of the said apartment to the complainant immediately  
c  direct the opposite party to pay an interest  24  per annum on the deposited amount of 1 06 07 581   to the complainants calculated for 36 months from the date of sanction of building plan   six months grace period i.e  11 th February  2013 till date which is calculated at 82 09 395   on account of failure on the part of the opposite party to abide by the terms and conditions of the Apartment Buyers Agreement and to deliver actual physical possession of the flat on time  
d  direct the opposite party to pay damages and compensation   30 lacs to the complainants on account of intense mental pain and agony  unending harassment  deficiency in service  deceptive and restrictive and unfair trade practice suffered by the complainants due to the illegal acts and conduct of the opposite party since the date of booking of their flat which is continuing till date  
e  direct the opposite party to pay a sum of 5 00 000   to the complainants separately towards cost of litigations  and 
f  pass such other or further order  s   directions s   which this Hon’ble Commission may deem fit and proper in the fact and circumstances of the present case  in favour of the complainants. 
 It is clear that the complainants want to take possession of the flat and the opposite party had already completed the building and had made offer of possession vide their letter dated 29.12.2 After that  there was exchange of several communications between the parties and the complainants did not take the possession on account of one reason or the other. It is seen that after getting the offer letter dated 29.12.2015  the complainants first objected towards club membership and club charges. They wrote vide letter dated 4.1.2016 and opposite party replied on 7.1.2016 waiving off these charges to the tune of Rs4 09 000  .On the request of the complainants for reducing Rs59 305   under “Quick Real Estate Pvt. Ltd.” charges vide opposite party’s e mail dated 25.01.2 After that also  the complainants did not pay the due amount to the opposite party and did not take the possession. The complainants further engaged in corresponding with the opposite party for seeking certain clarifications and for demanding more and more concessions and interest. There was no agreement for paying interest for delay period in handing over the possession. Therefore  the complainants were not really justified in delaying the taking over of the possession beyond 01.02.2016 by which date the major requests of the complainants were already agreed to by the opposite party. 
 This Commission has already taken a view in many cases that the compensation  Rs5 or 7.5   per sq.ft  per month does not really fully compensate the allottee for the delayed possession  and therefore there is a record to compensate the allottee by ordering payment of some interest on the amount deposited. In the present case  clearly the complainants are not entitled to get compensation for delayed possession beyond 1.2.2 Thus  the complainants would be entitled to get interest  5   five percent  on the amount of deposits viz Rs1 06 07 085   from 11.02.2013 till 31.01.2016 over and above the penalty for delayed possession  Rs7.5 per sq.ft  per month as per the agreement. 
 Interest is in the form of compensation and hence separate compensation for mental agony and harassment is not being awarded. The complainants would also be entitled to Rs25 000   as cost of litigation. 
 On the basis of above discussion  the complaint is allowed and following order is passed 
 ORDER 
 i  The opposite parties are directed to handover the possession of the said flat complete in all respect as per the provisions of the agreement within a period of 45 days from the date of receipt service of this order. 
 ii  Opposite parties shall also pay interest  5  p.a  on the amount of Rs1 06 07 085   from 11.02.2013 till 31.01.2016 over and above the penalty for delayed possession   Rs7.5 per sq.ft  per month as per the agreement.This amount of interest shall be adjusted at the time of giving possession and if the surplus amount is to be paid to the complainant  the same will be paid at the time of handing over the possession. 
 iii  Opposite parties shall also pay Rs25 000   to the complainants as cost of the complaint.
