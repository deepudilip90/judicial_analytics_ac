       It is stated that the allotment letter of the new unit i.e. B 1101 was received on 19.07.2013 by the Complainant along with payment schedule for a 2 BHK flat with first 3 installments as ₹10 lakhs  ₹17 lakhs and ₹18 lakhs respectively which was actually as per the payment schedule of a 3 BHK flat.  the Developer asked him to pay ₹35 lakhs immediately as instalment which was not acceptable and was requested to send a payment schedule plan as per 2 BHK flat as agreed earlier.  On 26.07.2013  the Developer mailed a statement of account demanding payment of ₹19 lakhs instead of ₹35 lakhs which was in accordance with 2 BHK payment plan along with interest.  Complainant objected to the unilateral demand for interest and refused to pay any interest as the delay in sending the payment schedule as per 2 BHK flat was due to the default on the part of the Developer.  On 02.08.2013 the Developer again approached him and agreed that he may deposit ₹6 lakhs immediately and ₹10 lakhs within a month as per 2 BHK payment plan.  Complainant agreed to pay the sum of ₹19 lakhs in 3 installments of ₹6 lakhs  ₹10 lakhs and ₹3 lakhs respectively within 3 weeks on the condition that the Developer may disclose the service tax paid by them or otherwise refund the money deposited by him.  However  despite repeated requests  the Developer did not furnish the proof of the amount of Service Tax against the flat and asked for a payment of ₹19 07 553   as per 2 BHK payment plan along with the interest of ₹93 608  .  The Complainant again objected for levy of interest on the ground that the delay occurred on the part of the Developer.  However  he was informed that he would have to pay interest otherwise his allotment would be cancelled and his deposited amount would be forfeited.  On 26.08.2013 the Developer replied through email demanding payment of ₹19 lakhs and that they would consider the waiver of interest.  On 26.09.2013 a cheque of ₹19 lakhs was sent to the Developer only on a clear understanding with the Developer that no interest would be levied on him and that Complainant would have to pay only as per agreed 2 BHK payment schedule.  On 25.11.2013 Complainant received a Builder Buyer Agreement describing first three instalment as ₹10 lakhs  ₹17 lakhs and ₹18 lakhs respectively as per 3 BHK flat payment plan  despite the Developer repeatedly agreeing on mails dated 26.07.2013  06.08.2013 and 29.09.2013 to charge demands only for 2 BHK.  Complainant again wrote to the Developer thereby again clarifying that he has agreed to pay future instalments and had paid ₹19 lakhs as per 2 BHK payment plan with the agreement consent of the Developer as recorded in their multiple e mails.  the Developer despite having agreed and received ₹19 lakhs as per 2 BHK payment plan  demanded another sum of ₹17 lakhs.  On 02.12.2013 the Complainant requested them to send a fresh Builder Buyer Agreement for a 2 BHK flat as per Payment Plan applicable for 2 BHK unit.  As he did not receive any reply from the Developer he refused to agree on the annexed payment plan as contained in the Builder Buyer Agreement.  He cancelled the payment plan and made endorsement on the same that the said payment plan was not acceptable to him and signed it.  In January  2015 Complainant visited the office of the Developer in order to execute the fresh Builder Buyer Agreement for the new allotted 2 BHK flat  B3 1103 .  However  he was informed that the new agreement stands already executed.  When he demanded copy of the same  he was shocked to find that the Developer committed forgery in the old agreement by tearing the Payment Plan Annexure where endorsement of “Not Acceptable” was written by the Complainant and instead affixed new payment plan annexure and re pasted over it again.   The Complainant categorically told the officials of the Developer including the Managing Director that the Buyer Agreement is clearly forged and that he would lodge an FIR against the Developer. On hearing this  the officials of the Developer tried to persuade the Complainant and agreed to settle all his claims.  He succumbed to pressure as he was in India for a brief visit only. 

       It is stated that the License No  68 dated Z1 06 2012 issued by the DTCP  Haryana to Second Opposite Party  hereinafter referred to as “Florentine Estates”  and Step Realty Pvt. Ltd  and the same was valid upto 20.06.2 Since no information was being provided by the Opposite Parties to the Complainant regarding the approvals permissions granted for development of the said project  the Complainant filed an RTI application dated 23.07 2016  which was received in the office of the DICP. Haryana on 29.07 2016  seeking details regarding the License No  68 of 2012 issued by the DTCP to Florentine Estates. In its reply dated 16.08.2016 to the said RTI application  the office of the DTCP has informed to the complainant that License No  68 of  2012 has been issued in favour of Florentine Estates.  It has been further informed that no permission has been granted to Florentine Estates to enter into any Collaboration Agreement with the Developer and they do not have legal authority to enter into any collaboration agreement with each other for development of a residential project with respect to the licence No  68 of 2012 dated 21.06.2012 issued by DTCP to Florentine Estates.  It is averred that the Developer has no legal authority to enter into any sale agreement with intending buyers in the said project and to receive consideration from prospecting buyers. However  in spite of the fact that the Developer has no legal authority and or permission to deal with the said project  they issued various newspaper advertisements in leading newspapers representing that they are developing a residential project named as  EMERALD BAY  at Sector 104  in Gurgaon  Haryana. It was represented on the part of the OPs that they have the legal  authority requisite approvals from DTCP to develop high end Apartment Villa etc  in the said project. It was further represented on the part of OPs that the said project would have ultra luxury facilities and amenities having the best infrastructure facilities in Gurgaon and the said project is a hallmark of luxury. It is averred that the Developer was not entitled to receive the money since the license for the project has been issued to M S FLORENTINE ESTATES and in favour of STEP Realty and hence the Developer has no authority to develop  construct and market the said project in the name of EMERALD BAY. Hence  acceptance of money from public at large for selling the flats is nothing but cheating and blatant violation of provisions of Haryana Development   Regulation of Urban Areas Act  1975 and Rules made thereunder and the said act of the Developer is  therefore illegal  unlawful and amounts to unfair trade practice.

       It is further averred that Section 2 d  of the Haryana  Development   Regulation of Urban Areas  Act  1975  hereinafter referred to as the Haryana Act of 1975  defines the term  colonizer  to mean an individual  company or association  body of individuals  whether incorporated or not owning land for converting it into a colony and to whom a license has been granted under this Act. Thus  the term as defined  requires that a colonizer must necessarily hold the land in its ownership to apply and get a license. In the present case  undeniably  till the filing of the Complaint  the Developer is neither owner of any part of the land comprised of Emerald Bay  project nor any license has been granted by the DTCP  Haryana in its name. Therefore  the Developer meets none of the essential conditions of a  Colonizer  as prescribed under Section 24 of the Haryana Act of 1 It is further submitted that only in order to make illegal and unjust benefit the Opposite Parties herein have devised a novelty to circumvent the law in the manner that the license No68 of 2012 which has been granted by the DTCP  Haryana in favour of Florentine Estates and others  have unilaterally without any prior permission or approval from DTCP  Haryana have transformed the whole project to the Developer to act as the  Coloniser  without any authority of law. Vide Memo No. PF 51A 2015 2708 dated 18.02.2015  DTCP Haryana has laid down policy parameters for allowing change in beneficial interest viz  change in Developer  assignment of joint development rights and or marketing rights etc  in a  license granted under Haryana Development   Regulation of Urban Areas Act  1 Rule 17 of the said Rules of 1976 made under the said Act  as it was then stood  prohibited transfer of licence without prior approval of the DTCP. Even the beneficial interest could not be done without such prior approval. The DTCP  Haryana in response to RTI application vide its reply dated 16.08.2006 has also informed to the Complainant that no permission was granted to Florentine Estates to enter into Collaboration Agreement with the Developer in respect of the said licence. It was stated  that as per the said of license issued by the DTCP  Haryana  the License No  68 dated 2106 2012  was valid upto 20.06.2016 and the same has expired long back. It is stated that the acts and omissions committed by the Opposite Parties fall within the definition of unfair trade practice.  Hence the present Complaint.

       Both the Developer and Florentine Estates filed their joint Written Version taking the preliminary objection that under the terms and conditions agreed between the parties the matter has to be settled through Arbitration  it is stated that there is no unfair trade practice on their part  the disposal of present Complaint needs detailed and elaborate evidence and thus could be adjudicated only by a Civil court  the Complainant is a pure investor and is not covered within the definition of “consumer”  no cause of action arose in favour of the Complainant as no wrong has been committed by them and Complainant is estopped from filing the present Complaint due to his own act and conduct as he was in absolute knowledge of all the facts relating to the Licence No  68 of 2012 and Florentine Estates being party to the Buyers Agreement. On merits all the allegations regarding unfair practices  deficient negligence and unlawful acts against them have been denied  it is stated that the Complainant belongs to educated elite strata of society and he booked the subject unit after going through all the contents of the application form  Complainant be directed to furnish the copy of his latest passport to ascertain whether he is an Indian citizen or not  the Complainant is a pure investor as he has also invested in the projects of M s Vatika Ltd  and M s Ireo Ltd  it is denied that any meeting was ever held by the Complainant with Mr. Arjun Puri  Complainant never met the representatives of the Developer rather he booked the subject unit through a broker i.e. Portfolio Realty Management Services  it is stated that the booking amount for a 2 BHK unit was ₹5 lakhs and for a 3 BHK unit was ₹10 lakhs and the Complainant had provided a cheque of ₹10 lakhs and a 3 BHK unit was allocated to him  the specifications elaborated in paragraph 4 of the Complainant was denied  the Complainant signed the Agreement after going through all the contents including the consideration amount  it is denied that the process of booking was completed within 3 days  as the Complainant provided a cheque of ₹10 lakhs a 3 BHK unit was allocated to him as per terms and conditions  however the Complainant had changed his mind regarding the unit subsequently due to huge demand in 2 BHK category  they offered him refund of the deposited amount but Complainant out of his own volition and to earn huge profits  on a smaller unit whose demand was huge  kept on pressing the Developer for allotment of a smaller unit  demand letter was issued to the Complainant as per the payment schedule agreed  accepted and opted by the Complainant  agreeing to the demand of the Complainant  they offered another unit  however  on his request again another unit was offered to him which was accepted by him  that fresh unit allotted to the Complainant was as per liking of the Complainant  the allegation regarding forfeiture of amount was denied  Complainant was asked to deposit the amounts of instalments as applicable to a 2 BHK unit which he had agreed to pay in two instalments  it is stated that they waived off the interest and demanded only principal amount from the Complainant  as the Complainant needed time to make payments  he kept on raising baseless issues with them  the perusal of all the e mails exchanged between them and the Complainant would reveal only one factor that the Complainant is a very clever person and purely an investor and was just gaining time to earn huge profits on the booking amount which he could not earn and hence he raised frivolous issues  they never pressurized or forced the Complainant  all the demands were raised as per the agreed payment plans  the details of the Licence were mentioned in the Application Form as well as in the Buyers Agreement which were duly accepted and executed by the Complainant after going through the same carefully  both the Developer and Florentine Estates jointly entered into Buyers Agreement with the Complainant  Florentine Estates is an associate company of the Developer and adequate arrangements exist between them for the development of the project  all the requisite information had been submitted with the concerned authorities  all these facts were in the absolute knowledge of the Complainant as well as in the public domain  that the licence was in the name of  Florentine Estates was in the absolute knowledge of the Complainant  the Opposite Parties got the Licence renewed till 20.06.2018  the Complainant was not misled  the Opposite Parties have already invested a sum of money in the development of the subject property  they have completed the project and would be delivering possession after receipt of Occupation Certificate in the next 6 9 months and therefore the Complainant is not entitled for any relief.  

       The Complainant in support of his case marked the copy of cheque dated 15.01.2013 for ₹10 00 000  as Annexure C 1  copy of the letter dated 25.02.2013 issued by the Developer as Annexure C 2  copy of the emails dated 09.03.2013  11.03.2013 and 13.03.2013 as Annexure C 3 collectively   copy of the letter dated 12.03.2013 issued by the Developer as Annexure C 4  copy of the e mail dated 27.04.2013 and others exchanged between the Developer and reply sent by the Complainant as Annexure C 5 collectively  copy of demand note dated 01.05.2013 sent by the Developer as Annexure C 6  copy of the allotment letter for Unit No. B3 1101 dated 13.07.2013 as B3 1101 dated 13.07.2013 as Annexure C 7  copy of the e mails exchanged between the Developer and Complainant on 19.07.2013 as Annexure C 8 collectively   copy of the e mail dated 02.08.2013 sent by the Developer as Annexure C 9  copy of e mail dated 16.08.13 and 26.09.13 as Annexure C 10   copy of the e mails dated 23.08.2013  24.08.2013 and 26.08.2013 exchanged between the Developer and Complainant as Annexure C 11 collectively   copy of the Builder Buyer’s Agreement as Annexure C 12  copy of the relevant portion of the list of licenses issued by DTCP downloaded by DTCP  Haryana website as annexure C 13  copy of the RTI application dated  23.07.2016 and DTCP reply dated 16.08.16 as Annexure C 14 collectively  copy of Memo.

       Opposite Parties in support of their case proved the following documents   copy of Board Resolution dated 02.05.2014  copy of Board Resolution of Florentine Estate  copy of letter dated 11.04.2017 issued by DGTCP as Annexure R 1 and copies of photographs showing the status of the project as Annexure           R  
       We have heard the Learned Counsel for the parties and perused the material on record.      

     Admitted facts are that the Complainant Paid an amount of ₹75 53 217   in total for a 2 BHK Flat No. B3 1103 in the project ‘Emrald Bay’ at Sector 104  Gurgaon  Haryana. Learned Counsel appearing for the Complainant vehemently contended that though the initial booking in the pre launch period was for a                 2 BHK and a cheque dated 15.01.2013 was also accepted by the agent of the Developer towards 2 BHK  the conditional offer of allotment was sent to the Complainant on 02.02.2013 for a 3 BHK  which offer was declined by the Complainant. It was submitted that after series of communication vide emails for a period of three months  the Developer demanded an amount of ₹35 00 000   pending towards 3 BHK allotment  it was once again declined by the Complainant and he sought for refund of the money paid. It is the Complainant’s case that the Developer had unilaterally converted the allotment of 2 BHK to 3 BHK thereby changing the payment plan and amounts after having received ₹29 00 000   towards second instalment  which amounts to unfair trade practice. The second installment of ₹29 00 000   was paid on an assurance given to the Complainant vide email that penalty and delayed period charges would not be demanded.

     A perusal of the material on record  evidences  that even after receipt of ₹29 00 000   towards second installment  the Complainant received another notice demanding an amount of ₹17 00 000    in addition to the interest on delayed payment  which was due and payable for the earlier 3 BHK allotment. It is not in dispute that the Developer thereafter rectified the amount and asked the Complainant to pay ₹19 00 000   towards third installment due and payable for 2 BHK and assured him that no further amount shall be demanded. It is seen from the record that after making the payment of ₹58 00 000   in total  the Developer still demanded a balance of ₹17 00 000   in addition to the interest as the accounting system was computerized and  the Complainant  had to make the payments as per 3 BHK plans and it was assured that later on the instalments would be lesser proportionately  which the Complainant declined. The new payment plan was annexed with the Builder Buyer Agreement dated December  2013  which was not acceptable to the Complainant and therefore he had reverted to the Developer and sought for a meeting as he wanted the requisite change be made in the Builder Buyer Agreement  it is evident from the exhibits that between March 2014 and September 2014 no demands were made by  the Developer. Subsequently  in the month of September 2014  there were three demands made for ₹14 00 000    ₹13 00 000   and ₹12 00 000   approximately demanding that the amounts to be paid immediately failing which the Complainant would be charged penal interest. Learned Counsel appearing for the Complainant argued that the statement also showed penalty interest and pending amount due for 3 BHK  which the Developer have clarified in March 2014  saying that the penalty was pending and all dues were clear.

     Learned Counsel appearing for the Developer argued that the only grievance raised in the Complaint with respect to regarding the allotment of 3 BHK instead of 2 BHK  which is devoid of merit and a stale argument  as interest waiver was given to the Complainant and in January  2015 as special concession on the request of the Complainant himself his construction linked plan was converted to a 50 50 payment plan and therefore his grievance in addition to allotment of 3 BHK was barred by limitation.

     From the exhibits marked and the photos filed by the Complainant  it is evident that the Complainant had initially booked for 2 BHK but the payments were demanded for 3 BHK as the Provisional Allotment Letter was given for 3 BHK and despite repeated protests and a series of emails  which was not denied by the Developer  the requisite correction with respect to payment plan was never made and this act of the Developer amounts to deficiency of service.

     Now we address ourselves to the contention of the Complainant that the Developer had violated Clause 5 of the Building Plan Approvals and has collected the amounts and booked the units before the grant of Building Plan Approvals. It is argued that housing license No  68 of 2012 under Section 3 of Haryana Development   Regulation of Urban Areas Act  1975  hereinafter referred to as “Haryana Act No  8 of 1975”  for the said project has been granted  to Florentine Estates on 21.06.2 It is the case of the Complainant based on the information received under RTI  that there is no registered Collaboration Agreement on record  which is supposed to be executed before concerned Sub Registrar between the Developer and the license holder  land owning company in terms of the policy vide Memo No. PF 51A 2015 2708 dated 18.02.2015 and issued from the office of Director General Town   Country Planning  Chandigarh  DGTCP . Learned Counsel appearing for the Complainant further submitted that the Developer does not have copy of the approval  permission granted by the DGTCP Chandigarh  that here is no document on record  which shows that any amount is paid or deposited towards administrative charges in compliance of Clause No  3 of the aforenoted policy Memo  that there is no document on record to establish whether any approval was granted  by DGTCP to the second Opposite Party for creating third party rights in favour of the Developer against housing license No  68 of 2012 and therefore the Builder Buyer Agreement ought to have been executed by both the Opposite Parties  whereas  it was negligently executed by the Developer.

     Learned Counsel appearing for the Opposite Parties vehemently contended that the Complainant was very much in the knowledge that the license issued to second Opposite Party was renewed by the same authority and that Occupation Certificate was also issued by the concerned authority  pursuant to which both the Opposite Parties have already offered possession to all the allottees and executed numerous conveyance deeds. He vehemently argued that the Complainant’s prayer of the refund of the amount paid stood negated as the licenses were renewed  Occupation Certificate was obtained  possession was offered and conveyance deeds were executed with other allottees.

     It is the case of the Opposite Parties that the refund was not sought on the ground of change of payment plan or the allotment of 3 BHK instead of 2 BHK  but it was sought on the ground that the license  which was issued in favour of second Opposite Party has lapsed and that there was no license in favour of first Opposite Party and hence first Opposite Party could not have sold the flats in contravention to provisions of Haryana Act No  8 of 1 
     We find force in the contention of the learned Counsel appearing for the Opposite Parties that since the Occupation Certificate dated 21.11.2018 has already been issued by the concerned authority  the license was issued to the second Opposite Party has been renewed and numerous conveyance deeds have already been executed  the question of adjudicating on approvals and licences at this stage  does not arise. Now  we address ourselves to the contention of the Complainant that there was a delay in the handing over of possession of the unit.

     A perusal of the Builder Buyer Agreement dated 28.12.2013  shows that the promised date of delivery of possession was 48 months from that date  which expires on 27.12.2017 and the additional grace period ended on 27.06.2018  the date on which there was no Occupation Certificate . It is seen from the record that batch of similar matters i.e. Consumer Complaint Nos  3236 to 3239 of 2017 in Harish Chawla Vs. Puri Construction Private Limited   Anr.  filed by the Complainants against the same Opposite Parties  with respect to the same project was allowed in part directing for refund of the amount with 12  interest. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in Civil Appeal Nos  4472 4475 of 2019  Puri Constructions Pvt. Ltd   Anr. Vs. Harish Chawla Etc  preferred by the Opposite Parties has confirmed the order of this Commission but modified the rate of interest from 12  to 8  giving a period of 8 weeks from the date of order i.e  07.05.2019 to the Opposite Parties to pay the amounts. As these matters have attained finality  on a pointed query from the Bench  learned Counsel appearing for the Opposite Parties submitted that they had preferred a clarification before the Hon’ble Supreme Court vide M.A. Dairy No  23229 of 2019 in Civil Appeal No  4472 of 2019 seeking the direction that the judgement in Harish Chawla  Supra  not to be treated as a binding precedent and be confined to the peculiar facts of that case.  Learned Counsel appearing for the Opposite Party also argued that there was a delay of only 7 months and that the date of offer of possession is 23.01.2019  whereas the promised date of delivery as per Clause 11 of the Builder Buyer Agreement ended on 28.06.2 He also submitted that this delay of 7 months should not strictly be construed as delay as force majeure conditions namely  orders passed by the National Green Tribunal  demonetisation etc  have led to this delay and hence the reasonable delay of 7 months  in offering possession cannot be attributed to the Opposite Parties as they have diligently completed the construction.

     The Hon’ble Supreme Court in Miscellaneous Application Nos  1310 1313 of 2019 in Civil Appeal No  4472 4475 of 2019 has observed as under 

“The order dated 7 May 2019 has been passed in the facts which were presented before this Court in CA Nos 4472 4475 of 2  Hence  this does not amount to the expression of any finding on law or facts with regard to any other disputes pending before any other fora and which were not the subject matter of the above appeals.”

     In the aforenoted order the Hon’ble Supreme Court has noted that the order passed on 07.05.2019 does not amount to the expression of any finding of law or facts which is not the subject matter of above Appeals. In Harish Chawla  Supra    the period of delay was 15 to 18 months and the delay in the present case is approximately 7 months. This Commission in  Emmar MGF Land Ltd   Ors.  vs. Amit Puri  II  2015  CPJ 568 NC   which has since attained finality has observed that any delay beyond the promised date of the delivery Complainant can seek refund of the amount paid  however with respect to the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case  we are of the considered view that if the Complainant is interested in taking possession and the Opposite Parties waive of the interest and penalty amounts which have been charged since the record shows that there was an error in demanding payments of 3 BHK  when the correspondence communication shows that the Developer agreed  that the payment plan towards 2 BHK  but have consistently and continuously demanded amounts towards 3 BHK without making the necessary correction  the delay cannot be safely attributed to the Complainant. Keeping in view the dates and communication involved in this case  viewed from any angle  it cannot be stated that the grievance in relation to 3 BHK is barred by limitation. There was no negligence on behalf of the Complainant in payment of the amounts therefore if the Complainant is interested in taking possession of the Apartment despite the admittedly delay the Developer can offer the same waiving all the interest and penalty amounts. In the alternative at the Complainant’s discretion  the Opposite Parties shall refund the amounts deposited by the Complainant with interest                   8  p.a  from the respective dates of deposit till the date of realisation  the interest rate which has been as modified by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Civil Appeal Nos  4472 4475 of 2019  together with costs of ₹25 000  . Time for compliance four weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order failing which  the amount shall attract interest   10  p.a  for the same period.
